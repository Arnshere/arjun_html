<p>A school is a structured educational institution designed to provide learning environments for students under the
guidance of teachers, covering primary to secondary education. These institutions promote academic growth, social skill
development, and confidence, often serving as mandatory, community-focused hubs for children. They vary from
traditional, in-person schools to specialized institutions, generally fostering both intellectual and personal
development.</p>
